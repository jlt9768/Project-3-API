Our project will allow the user to figure out the current weather in a given location. The location
can either be searched or manually clicked, on the map. The admin app will include the cities/locations
that have been searched. We are using the Google Maps API and the OpenWeatherMap API.

In its current state the user can click on, or search, a location on the map and they will be centered
onto that location. Markers are placed that display the current temperature and weather in the given location.
We are going to add the ability to see the future forecasted weather of the last clicked location in a side
bar location.
